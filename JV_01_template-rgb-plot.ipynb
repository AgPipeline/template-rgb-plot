    "* Author1 = {\"name\": \"Chris Schnaufer\", \"affiliation\": \"Cyverse/University of Arizona Data Scientist\", \"email\": \"schnaufer@arizona.edu\", \"orcid\": \"0000-0002-6150-4558\"}\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop and test an Algorithm to process RGB images that correspond to experiment plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to assist researchers integrate their algorithms into Drone Processing Pipeline workflows through an easy to use interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based off the [template-rgb-plot](https://github.com/AgPipeline/template-rgb-plot) template repository of the University of Arizona [AgPipeline](https://github.com/AgPipeline) project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have an algorithm that processes RGB data to produce one or more measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have working knowledge of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Python environment is version 3.5 or newer\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are familiar with [Github template repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository), or know how to use [git](https://git-scm.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "* For testing purposes, a folder named *sample_plot_images*, containing sample plot images, is located in the same directory as this jupyter notebook. An archive of sample plot images can be [downloaded from CyVerse](https://de.cyverse.org/dl/d/4108BB75-AAA3-48E1-BBD4-E10B06CADF54/sample_plot_images.zip)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are followed:\n",
    "1. Clone the GitHub template to your organization or git repository\n",
    "2. Declare parameters describing the algorithm\n",
    "3. Write the Algorithm that returns the calculated values\n",
    "4. Export the algorithm to a python file which can be tested and added to a repository\n",
    "5. Test the algorithm to confirm it works as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps for building and testing a Docker image containing the algorithm follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook enables a user to develop their own rgb image-processing algorithms in a structured way, validate their algorithm with a testing script, and add their algorithm to a repository. Optional steps are included for building a Docker image of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
