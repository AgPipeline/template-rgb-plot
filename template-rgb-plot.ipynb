    "\n",
    "##### This is an image-based template that can be used to test plot-level algorithms with RGB data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### It is assumed that:\n",
    "* An image folder is located in the root of this directory that will provide images for the calculate()function to process. Sample plot images can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWRU0YgK3Y9aUy5TdRxj14gmjLlozGxo/view)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are generating a Docker image containing your algorithm and that you have Docker installed on your\n",
    "computer\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are familiar with Github template repositories, or know how to use git\n",

    "* [transformer-rgb-indices](https://github.com/AgPipeline/transformer-rgb-indices)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Setup\n",
    "The following steps can be taken to clone this repo and generate a complete README.md for your algorithm, and then develop your algorithm for inclusion into a processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Setup](#setup): Click the `Use this template` button in [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/AgPipeline/template-rgb-plot) to make a copy of this repository (or run `git clone`)\n",
    "2. [Definitions](#definitions): Fill in and modify the metadata in the codemeta.json file\n",
    "3. [Generate full README.md](#readme): Run the command `npm install @appnest/readme -D` to install a module that can generate the final README and follow the steps below\n",
    "4. [Algorithm](#algorithm): Replace the code in the `calculate` function with your algorithm\n",
    "5. [Generate](#generate): Run `generate.py` to create a Dockerfile\n",
    "6. [Test](#test): Run the `testing.py` script to run your algorithm and validate the results\n",
    "7. [Docker](#build_docker): Create a Docker image for your algorithm and publish it\n",
    "8. [Testing Your docker image](#test_docker): OPTIONAL\n",
    "9. [Testing Image Production](#production): OPTIONAL\n",
    "10. [Finishing](#finishing): Finish up your development efforts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup your repo <a name=\"setup\"/>\n",
    "The first thing to do is to create a copy of this repository has a meaningful name and that you are able to modify.\n",
    "In GitHub this is easy, browse to this [repository](https://github.com/AgPipeline/template-rgb-plot) and click the `Use this template` button.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Use This Template example](demonstrations/UseThisTemplate.png)](demonstrations/UseThisTemplate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be led through the steps necessary to create a clone in a location of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not on GitHub, you will need to setup your `git` environment and clone the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, you should have a repository that looks like the initial template\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fill in your definitions <a name=\"definitions\" />\n",
    "To fill in the needed definitions, first open the `codemeta.json` file in your favorite editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![codemeta.json example](demonstrations/codemetajson.png)](demonstrations/codemetajson.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are modifying your existing code, you should consider updating the version number definition: `version`.\n",
    "It's assumed that [Semantic Version numbers](https://semver.org/) will be used, but any methodology can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the algorithm definitions with the creator(s) of the algorithm: `author(s)`, `author_email(s)`, `algorithm_name`, and `algorithm_description`.\n",
    "It's best if only one algorithm name is used, but call it what you want.\n",
    "The safest algorithm naming convention to use is to convert any white-space or other characters to periods (.) which allows different systems to more-easily change the name, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next fill in the citation information that will be used in the generated CSV file: `citation_author`, `citation_title`, and `citation_year`.\n",
    "Be sure to enter the citation information accurately since some systems may expect exact matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The names of the variables are used to determine the number of returned values your algorithm produces: `variable_names`.\n",
    "Enter each variable name for each returned value, in the order they are returned, separated by a comma.\n",
    "Be sure to enter them accurately since some systems may expect exact matches.\n",
    "It is considered an error to have a mismatch between the number of variables names and the number of returned values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now open algorithm_rgb.py\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file suitable for ingestion to [BETYdb](https://www.betydb.org/) is generated depending upon the value of the `WRITE_BETYDB_CSV` variable.\n",
    "Setting this value to `False` will suppress the generation of this file by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file suitable for ingestion to [TERRA REF Geostreams](https://docs.terraref.org/user-manual/data-products/environmental-conditions) is generated depending upon the value of the `WRITE_GEOSTREAMS_CSV` variable.\n",
    "Setting this value to `False` will suppress the generation of this file by default.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Be sure to save your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate full README <a name=\"readme\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "After you perform this step, a second README.md file should be generated that contains detailed information about how to generate, test, and publish the algorithm. \n",
    "Following the README.md generation instructions from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme#usage), first install @appnest/readme if you have not done\n",
    "so already using the command `npm install @appnest/readme`. Next run the command ```npx @appnest/readme generate --package codemeta.json``` in order to generate a complete README.md file. \n",
    "\n",
    "This substitutes data from codemeta.json into blueprint.md in order to generate a README file with the data you entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "The generated file should look similar to [this file](demonstrations/README.md)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, you will not be able to return to the original README.md without reverting your project state or cloning the repo again.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add your algorithm <a name=\"algorithm\" />\n",
    "Open the `algorithm_rgb.py` file in your favorite editor, if it isn't opened already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scroll to the bottom of the file to the function named `calculate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[![calculate example](demonstrations/calculate.png)](demonstrations/calculate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the comment starting with `# ALGORITHM` and the line below with your calculation(s).\n",
    "As needed, change the name of array used in your algorithm to the function's parameter `pxarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your algorithm in place, replace the comment starting with `# RETURN` and the line below with your return values.\n",
    "Remember to order your return values to match the declared names in the `VARIABLE_NAMES` definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the rest of the file as necessary if there are additional import statements, functions, classes, and other code needed by your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to save your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate the Docker build command file <a name=\"generate\" />\n",
    "It's time to generate the Dockerfile that's used to build Docker images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker images can be used as part of a workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "To assist in this effort we've provided a script named `generate.py` to produce a file containing the Docker commands needed.\n",
    "Running this script will not only produce a Docker command file, named `Dockerfile` but also two other files that can be used to install additional dependencies your algorithm needs.\n",
    "These two other files are named `requirements.txt` for additional Python modules and `packages.txt` for other dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate these files, just run `./generate.py` in the terminal from the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your algorithm has additional python module dependencies, edit `requirements.txt` and add the names of the modules.\n",
    "The listed modules will then be installed as part of the Docker build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are other dependencies needed by your algorithm, add them to the `packages.txt` file.\n",
    "The packages listed will be installed using `apt-get` as part of the Docker build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test your algorithm <a name=\"test\"/>\n",
    "A testing script named `testing.py` is provided for testing your algorithm.\n",
    "It checks whether the configuration is correct for testing the files by making sure that the arguments in algorithm_rgb as well as the image files are in the correct format\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing script requires `numpy` and `gdal` to be installed on the testing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your files reside in `/user/myself/test_images` the command to test could be the following:\n",
    "```./testing.py /user/myself/test_images```\n",
    "\n",
    "What isn't provided in the template repository are the plot-level RGB images to test against.\n",
    "It's expected that you will either provide the images or use a standard set that can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWRU0YgK3Y9aUy5TdRxj14gmjLlozGxo/view?usp=sharing).\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing script expects to have either a list of source plot image files, or a folder name, or both specified on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the Docker image <a name=\"build_docker\" />\n",
    "Now that you have generated your `Dockerfile` as described [above](#generate) and specified any Python modules and other packages needed by your algorithm, you are ready to create a Docker image of your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample Docker build command could be: ```docker build -t my_algorithm:latest ./```\n",
    "Please refer to the Docker documentation for additional information on building a docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the image is built, you can run it locally or push it to an image repository, such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).\n",
    "Please note that there may be naming requirements for pushing images to a repository. In order to push your image to DockerHub, you can follow [the following tutorial](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-docker-tutorial/04-Dockerhub.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (OPTIONAL) Using Docker to run testing.py <a name=\"test_docker\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test your docker image, you can use the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/mnt --entrypoint /mnt/testing.py my_algorithm:latest /mnt/images```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking apart this command line, we have the following pieces:\n",
    "- `docker run` tells Docker to run an instance of the image (specified later in the command) (Refer to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) documentation)\n",
    "- `--rm` tells Docker to remove the container (an image instance) when it's completed\n",
    "- `it` allows you to have a stdin stream and terminal driver added to the docker container allowing an interactive session\n",
    "- `-v \"pwd\":/mnt` bind mounts a volume to the docker container so that the current working directory (given by pwd) will be copied into the volume\n",
    "- `--entrypoint /mnt/testing.py` defines the Docker container that will be run, with testing.py mounted to that container \n",
    "- `my_algorithm:latest` is the image to run (the running image is known as a *container*)\n",
    "- `/mnt/images` mounts the sample plot images to the running docker container\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output should be in the format of image name and calculated value for that image on a single line for each of the images in the images folder.\n",
    "Example output from the images in the [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xWRU0YgK3Y9aUy5TdRxj14gmjLlozGxo/view?usp=sharing) \n",
    "is contained below for plot images folder, with the folder titled sample_plot_images: \n",
    "    \n",
    "Using the original/unchanged calculate() function in algorithm_rgb.py, the output should look like the following: \n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"demonstrations/sample_results.png\" alt=\"sample results\" width=50%>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### (OPTIONAL) Production Testing of Image <a name=\"production\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same image setup as used when testing your algorithm, a sample command line to run the image could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```docker run --rm --mount \"src=/user/myself,target=/mnt,type=bind\" my_algorithm:latest --working_space \"/mnt\" --metadata \"mnt/experiment.yml\" \"/mnt/images\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking apart this command line, we have the following pieces:\n",
    "- `docker run` tells Docker to run an instance of the image (specified later in the command) (Refer to [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) documentation)\n",
    "- `--rm` tells Docker to remove the container (an image instance) when it's completed\n",
    "- `--mount \"src=/user/myself,target=/mnt,type=bind\"` specifies the */user/myself* path is to be made available as */mnt* in the container\n",
    "- `my_algorithm:latest` is the image to run (the running image is known as a *container*)\n",
    "- `--working_space \"/mnt\"` lets the software in the container know where its working disk space is located; files are created here\n",
    "- `--metadata \"mnt/experiment.yml\"` specifies that the metadata file experiment.yml will be made available to the container\n",
    "- `\"/mnt/images\"` specifies where the plot-level image files are located\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--mount` command line parameter is important since it allows the running container to access the local file system.\n",
    "The container can then load the images from the file system directly, without having to perform any copies.\n",
    "The parameters after the Docker image name are all relative to the target folder specified with this command line parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the image files have been processed, the resulting CSV file(s) will be located in the folder at `/user/myself` (in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result.json file should tell you what errors were found in the checks from testing.py (make sure to check the output in the CSV file(s) \n",
    "even if the result.json file does not find errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finishing up <a name=\"finishing\" />\n",
    "Now that you're created your algorithm, there's a few more things to take care of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you've checked in your changes into source control; you don't want to lose all that hard work!\n",
    "2. You can update the blueprint.md file if you have additional changes to make to the README. Then run ```npx @appnest/readme generate --package codemeta.json```,\n",
    "filling out the sections with information on your algorithm; others will want to know so they can use it!\n",
    "3. Submit any requests to our ticketing system on GitHub:  https://github.com/AgPipeline/computing-pipeline/issues/new/choose\n",
